/*

Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.

In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 14
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
Example 2:

Input: num = 8
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4. 
Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
Example 3:

Input: num = 123
Output: 12
 

Constraints:

0 <= num <= 106

    - Create a variable to count the number of steps
    - Create a loop that  continues while the input number is greater than 0

        - Increment the step counter
    - Return the step counter
